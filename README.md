# Ship IoT with Texas Instruments CC2650/CC2541 Sensortags, Beaglebone Black, and DeviceHive

This is a demonstration of the TI CC2650 / CC2541 Sensortags communicating
via Bluetooth Low-Energy to a Beaglebone Black. On the Beaglebone is a gateway
created with Node.js and Python, bridging the Sensortags to the DeviceHive
device management platform. From DeviceHive, the wot.io data service exchangeâ„¢
will send the data to a number of data services, such as scriptr, Circonus,
bip.io, and more.

### Usage

Set up a Beaglebone Black with Node.js and Python. You'll need a Bluetooth
dongle hooked via USB. Drop this repo on the Bone. Set up your config
options under `config/default.json` and then run `./start.sh`
